# CLI-Chat
This is a chat application which hosts its own server and can accommodate clients. Clients can then talk to each other (Locally on one machine) 


Firstly, run the server.py file which will initiate the server and open a port which will enable teh clients to connect and chat

Now, run the client.py file 2 times to chat


PS :   - Open the directory with the files and write ' cmd ' in place of teh file location in the File Explorer, then type 'python client.py' or 'python server.py' to run teh scripts. Using 'python client.py' in the opened terminal, you can easily open multiple client profiles
