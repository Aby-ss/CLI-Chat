*The terminal opens with the dir in the name*

PS :   - Open the directory with the files and write ' cmd ' in place of the file location in the File Explorer, then type 'python client.py' or 'python server.py' to run the scripts. Using 'python client.py' in the opened terminal, you can easily open multiple client profiles
